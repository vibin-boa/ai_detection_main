Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge to achieve practical goals especially in a reproducible way,human
The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines and intangible ones such as software,human
Technology plays a critical role in science engineering and everyday life,human
Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society,human
The earliest known technology is the stone tool used during prehistory followed by the control of fire—which in turn contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age according to the cooking hypothesis,human
The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines,human
More recent technological inventions including the printing press telephone and the Internet have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy,human
While technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity it can also have negative impacts like pollution and resource depletion and can cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation,human
As a result philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology the ethics of technology and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing,human
Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' from Greek Τεχνολογία from the Greek: τέχνη romanized: tékhnē lit,human
It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word τέχνη tékhnē used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things' which encompassed activities like architecture,human
Starting in the 19th century continental Europeans started using the terms Technik German or technique French to refer to a 'way of doing' which included all technical arts such as dancing navigation or printing whether or not they required tools or instruments,human
At the time Technologie German and French referred either to the academic discipline studying the methods of arts and crafts or to the political discipline intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts. The distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English and so both were translated as technology,human
The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,human
In the 20th century as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends,human
Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error,human
Around 2 Mya million years ago they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble forming a sharp hand axe,human
This practice was refined 75 kya thousand years ago into pressure flaking enabling much finer work,human
The discovery of fire was described by Charles Darwin as possibly the greatest ever made by man,human
Archaeological dietary and social evidence point to continuous human fire-use at least 1.5 Mya,human
Fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten,human
The cooking hypothesis proposes that the ability to cook promoted an increase in hominid brain size though some researchers find the evidence inconclusive,human
Archaeological evidence of hearths was dated to 790 kya researchers believe this is likely to have intensified human socialization and may have contributed to the emergence of language,human
Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era include clothing and shelter,human
No consensus exists on the approximate time of adoption of either technology but archaeologists have found archaeological evidence of clothing 90-120 kya and shelter 450 kya,human
As the Paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as 380 kya humans were constructing temporary wood huts,human
Clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of Africa around 200 kya initially moving to Eurasia,human
The Neolithic Revolution or First Agricultural Revolution brought about an acceleration of technological innovation and a consequent increase in social complexity,human
The invention of the polished stone axe was a major advance that allowed large-scale forest clearance and farming,human
This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic but was originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland,human
Agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed for the simultaneous raising of more children as infants no longer needed to be carried around by nomads,human
Additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could participate in hunter-gatherer activities,human
With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization,human
What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities such as Uruk and the first civilizations such as Sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war among adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role,human
The invention of writing led to the spread of cultural knowledge and became the basis for history libraries schools and scientific research,human
Continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided for the first time the ability to smelt and forge gold copper silver and lead native metals found in relatively pure form in nature,human
The advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times about 10 kya,human
Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires,human
Eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about BCE,human
The first use of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1,human
After harnessing fire humans discovered other forms of energy,human
The earliest known use of wind power is the sailing ship the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to around 7,human
From prehistoric times Egyptians likely used the power of the annual flooding of the Nile to irrigate their lands gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and catch basins,human
The ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for irrigation,human
Archaeologists estimate that the wheel was invented independently and concurrently in Mesopotamia in present-day Iraq the Northern Caucasus Maykop culture and Central Europe,human
Time estimates range from BCE with most experts putting it closer to BCE,human
The oldest artifacts with drawings depicting wheeled carts date from about BCE,human
More recently the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world as of 2024 was found in the Ljubljana Marsh of Slovenia Austrian experts have established that the wheel is between 5,human

It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads,human
The ancient Sumerians used a potter's wheel and may have invented it,human
A stone pottery wheel found in the city-state of Ur dates to around  BCE and even older fragments of wheel-thrown pottery have been found in the same area,human
Fast rotary potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy through water wheels windmills and even treadmills that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources,human
The first two-wheeled carts were derived from travois and were first used in Mesopotamia and Iran in around ,human
The oldest known constructed roadways are the stone-paved streets of the city-state of Ur dating to c,human
BCE and timber roads leading through the swamps of Glastonbury England dating to around the same period,human
The first long-distance road which came into use around BCE spanned  from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea but was not paved and was only partially maintained,human
In around  BCE the Minoans on the Greek island of Crete built a 50 km road leading from the palace of Gortyn on the south side of the island through the mountains to the palace of Knossos on the north side of the island,human
Unlike the earlier road the Minoan road was completely paved,human
Ancient Minoan private homes had running water,human
A bathtub virtually identical to modern ones was unearthed at the Palace of Knossos,human
Several Minoan private homes also had toilets which could be flushed by pouring water down the drain,human
The ancient Romans had many public flush toilets which emptied into an extensive sewage system,human
The primary sewer in Rome was the Cloaca Maxima construction began on it in the sixth century BCE and it is still in use today,human
The ancient Romans also had a complex system of aqueducts which were used to transport water across long distances,human
The first Roman aqueduct was built in 312 BCE,human
The eleventh and final ancient Roman aqueduct was built in 226 CE,human
Put together the Roman aqueducts extended over 450 km but less than 70 km of this was above ground and supported by arches,human

Information technology particularly optical fiber and optical amplifiers allowed for simple and fast long-distance communication which ushered in the Information Age and the birth of the Internet,human
The Space Age began with the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and later the launch of crewed missions to the moon in the 1960s,human
Organized efforts to search for extraterrestrial intelligence have used radio telescopes to detect signs of technology use or technosignatures given off by alien civilizations,human
In medicine new technologies were developed for diagnosis CT PET and MRI scanning treatment like the dialysis machine defibrillator pacemaker and a wide array of new pharmaceutical drugs and research like interferon cloning and DNA microarrays,human
Complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain more modern technologies and entire industries have arisen to develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools,human
Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education  their designers builders maintainers and users often require sophisticated general and specific training,human
Moreover these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have developed to support them including engineering medicine and computer science and other fields have become more complex such as construction transportation and architecture,human
Technological change is the largest cause of long-term economic growth,human
Throughout human history energy production was the main constraint on economic development and new technologies allowed humans to significantly increase the amount of available energy,human
First came fire which made edible a wider variety of foods and made it less physically demanding to digest them,human
Fire also enabled smelting and the use of tin copper and iron tools used for hunting or tradesmanship,human
Then came the agricultural revolution: humans no longer needed to hunt or gather to survive and began to settle in towns and cities forming more complex societies with militaries and more organized forms of religion,human
Technologies have contributed to human welfare through increased prosperity improved comfort and quality of life and medical progress but they can also disrupt existing social hierarchies cause pollution and harm individuals or groups,human
Recent years have brought about a rise in social media's cultural prominence with potential repercussions on democracy and economic and social life,human
Early on the internet was seen as a liberation technology that would democratize knowledge improve access to education and promote democracy,human
Modern research has turned to investigate the internet's downsides including disinformation polarization hate speech and propaganda,human
Since the 1970s technology's impact on the environment has been criticized leading to a surge in investment in solar wind and other forms of clean energy,human
Since the invention of the wheel technologies have helped increase humans' economic output,human
Past automation has both substituted and complemented labor machines replaced humans at some lower-paying jobs for example in agriculture but this was compensated by the creation of new higher-paying jobs,human
Studies have found that computers did not create significant net technological unemployment,human
Due to artificial intelligence being far more capable than computers and still being in its infancy it is not known whether it will follow the same trend the question has been debated at length among economists and policymakers,human
A 2017 survey found no clear consensus among economists on whether AI would increase long-term unemployment,human
According to the World Economic Forum's The Future of Jobs Report 2020 AI is predicted to replace 85 million jobs worldwide and create 97 million new jobs by 2025,human
From 1990 to 2007 a study in the U.S,human
by MIT economist Daron Acemoglu showed that an addition of one robot for every workers decreased the employment-to-population ratio by 0.2% or about 3.3 workers and lowered wages by 0.42%,human
Concerns about technology replacing human labor however are long-lasting,human
As US president Lyndon Johnson said in 1964 Technology is creating both new opportunities and new obligations for us opportunity for greater productivity and progress obligation to be sure that no workingman no family must pay an unjust price for progress. upon signing the National Commission on Technology Automation and Economic Progress bill,human

Although security measures are placed some criminals are able to bypass them,human
In March 2022 North Korea used Blender.io a mixer which helped them to hide their cryptocurrency exchanges to launder over $20.5 million in cryptocurrency from Axie Infinity and steal over $600 million worth of cryptocurrency from the game's owner,human
Treasury Department sanctioned Blender.io which marked the first time it has taken action against a mixer to try to crack down on North Korean hackers,human
The privacy of cryptocurrency has been debated,human
Although many customers like the privacy of cryptocurrency many also argue that it needs more transparency and stability,human
Technology can have both positive and negative effects on the environment,human
Environmental technology describes an array of technologies which seek to reverse mitigate or halt environmental damage to the environment,human
This can include measures to halt pollution through environmental regulations capture and storage of pollution or using pollutant byproducts in other industries,human
Other examples of environmental technology include deforestation and the reversing of deforestation,human
Emerging technologies in the fields of climate engineering may be able to halt or reverse global warming and its environmental impacts although this remains highly controversial,human
As technology has advanced so too has the negative environmental impact with increased release of greenhouse gases including methane nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere causing the greenhouse effect,human
This continues to gradually heat the earth causing global warming and climate change,human
Measures of technological innovation correlates with a rise in greenhouse gas emissions,human
Pollution the presence of contaminants in an environment that causes adverse effects could have been present as early as the Inca Empire,human
They used a lead sulfide flux in the smelting of ores along with the use of a wind-drafted clay kiln which released lead into the atmosphere and the sediment of rivers,human
Philosophy of technology is a branch of philosophy that studies the practice of designing and creating artifacts and the nature of the things so created. It emerged as a discipline over the past two centuries and has grown considerably since the 1970s,human
The humanities philosophy of technology is concerned with the meaning of technology for and its impact on society and culture,human
Initially technology was seen as an extension of the human organism that replicated or amplified bodily and mental faculties,human
Marx framed it as a tool used by capitalists to oppress the proletariat but believed that technology would be a fundamentally liberating force once it was freed from societal deformations,human
Second-wave philosophers like Ortega later shifted their focus from economics and politics to daily life and living in a techno-material culture arguing that technology could oppress even the members of the bourgeoisie who were its ostensible masters and possessors. Third-stage philosophers like Don Ihde and Albert Borgmann represent a turn toward de-generalization and empiricism and considered how humans can learn to live with technology,human
Early scholarship on technology was split between two arguments: technological determinism and social construction,human
Technological determinism is the idea that technologies cause unavoidable social changes  It usually encompasses a related argument technological autonomy which asserts that technological progress follows a natural progression and cannot be prevented,human
Social constructivists argue that technologies follow no natural progression and are shaped by cultural values laws politics and economic incentives,human
Modern scholarship has shifted towards an analysis of sociotechnical systems assemblages of things people practices and meanings looking at the value judgments that shape technology,human
Cultural critic Neil Postman distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and from what he called technopolies societies that are dominated by an ideology of technological and scientific progress to the detriment of other cultural practices values and world views,human
Herbert Marcuse and John Zerzan suggest that technological society will inevitably deprive us of our freedom and psychological health,human
The ethics of technology is an interdisciplinary subfield of ethics that analyzes technology's ethical implications and explores ways to mitigate potential negative impacts of new technologies,human

Estimates on the advent of artificial general intelligence vary but half of machine learning experts surveyed in 2018 believe that AI will accomplish every task better and more cheaply than humans by 2063 and automate all human jobs by 2140,human
This expected technological unemployment has led to calls for increased emphasis on computer science education and debates about universal basic income,human
Political science experts predict that this could lead to a rise in extremism while others see it as an opportunity to usher in a post-scarcity economy,human
Some segments of the 1960s hippie counterculture grew to dislike urban living and developed a preference for locally autonomous sustainable and decentralized technology termed appropriate technology,human
This later influenced hacker culture and technopaganism,human
 Technological utopianism ,human
Technological utopianism refers to the belief that technological development is a moral good which can and should bring about a utopia that is a society in which laws governments and social conditions serve the needs of all its citizens,human
Examples of techno-utopian goals include post-scarcity economics life extension mind uploading cryonics and the creation of artificial superintelligence,human
Major techno-utopian movements include transhumanism and singularitarianism,human
The transhumanism movement is founded upon the continued evolution of human life beyond its current human form through science and technology informed by life-promoting principles and values. The movement gained wider popularity in the early 21st century,human
Singularitarians believe that machine superintelligence will accelerate technological progress by orders of magnitude and create even more intelligent entities ever faster which may lead to a pace of societal and technological change that is incomprehensible to us,human
This event horizon is known as the technological singularity,human
Major figures of techno-utopianism include Ray Kurzweil and Nick Bostrom,human
Techno-utopianism has attracted both praise and criticism from progressive religious and conservative thinkers,human
 Anti-technology backlash ,human
Technology's central role in our lives has drawn concerns and backlash,human
The backlash against technology is not a uniform movement and encompasses many heterogeneous ideologies,human
The earliest known revolt against technology was Luddism a pushback against early automation in textile production,human
Automation had resulted in a need for fewer workers a process known as technological unemployment,human
Between the 1970s and 1990s American terrorist Ted Kaczynski carried out a series of bombings across America and published the Unabomber Manifesto denouncing technology's negative impacts on nature and human freedom,human

It was partly inspired by Jacques Ellul's The Technological Society,human
Some subcultures like the off-the-grid movement advocate a withdrawal from technology and a return to nature,human
The ecovillage movement seeks to reestablish harmony between technology and nature,human
 Relation to science and engineering ,human
Engineering is the process by which technology is developed,human
It often requires problem-solving under strict constraints,human
Technological development is action-oriented while scientific knowledge is fundamentally explanatory,human
Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: science concerns itself with what is technology with what is to be 375,human
The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists philosophers and policymakers,human
Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human
Despite this modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep domain-specific scientific knowledge,human
In 1975 there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S. by 1989 this increased to an average of one citation per patent,human
The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry chemistry and electronics,human
A 2021 analysis shows that patents that are based on scientific discoveries are on average 26% more valuable than equivalent non-science-based patents,human
The use of basic technology is also a feature of non-human animal species,human
Tool use was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus Homo,human
This view was supplanted after discovering evidence of tool use among chimpanzees and other primates dolphins and crows,human
For example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees using basic foraging tools pestles levers using leaves as sponges and tree bark or vines as probes to fish termites,human
West African chimpanzees use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista Brazil,human
Tool use is not the only form of animal technology use for example beaver dams built with wooden sticks or large stones are a technology with dramatic impacts on river habitats and ecosystems,human
The relationship of humanity with technology has been explored in science-fiction literature for example in Brave New World A Clockwork Orange Nineteen Eighty-Four Isaac Asimov's essays and movies like Minority Report Total Recall Gattaca and Inception,human
It has spawned the dystopian and futuristic cyberpunk genre which juxtaposes futuristic technology with societal collapse dystopia or decay,human
Notable cyberpunk works include William Gibson's Neuromancer novel and movies like Blade Runner and The Matrix,human
Gribbin John Alone in the Milky Way: Why we are probably the only intelligent life in the galaxy Scientific American vol,human
Is life likely to exist elsewhere in the [Mily Way galaxy Almost certainly yes given the speed with which it appeared on Earth,human
Is another technological civilization likely to exist today Almost certainly no given the chain of circumstances that led to our existence,human
These considerations suggest that we are unique not just on our planet but in the whole Milky Way,human
And if our planet is so special it becomes all the more important to preserve this unique world for ourselves our descendants and the many creatures that call Earth home. p,human

Philosophy of technology is a branch of philosophy that studies the practice of designing and creating artifacts and the nature of the things so created. It emerged as a discipline over the past two centuries and has grown considerably since the 1970s,human
The humanities philosophy of technology is concerned with the meaning of technology for and its impact on society and culture,human
Initially technology was seen as an extension of the human organism that replicated or amplified bodily and mental faculties,human
Marx framed it as a tool used by capitalists to oppress the proletariat but believed that technology would be a fundamentally liberating force once it was freed from societal deformations,human
Second-wave philosophers like Ortega later shifted their focus from economics and politics to daily life and living in a techno-material culture arguing that technology could oppress even the members of the bourgeoisie who were its ostensible masters and possessors. Third-stage philosophers like Don Ihde and Albert Borgmann represent a turn toward de-generalization and empiricism and considered how humans can learn to live with technology,human
Early scholarship on technology was split between two arguments: technological determinism and social construction,human
Technological determinism is the idea that technologies cause unavoidable social changes  It usually encompasses a related argument technological autonomy which asserts that technological progress follows a natural progression and cannot be prevented,human
Social constructivists argue that technologies follow no natural progression and are shaped by cultural values laws politics and economic incentives,human
Modern scholarship has shifted towards an analysis of sociotechnical systems assemblages of things people practices and meanings looking at the value judgments that shape technology,human

This later influenced hacker culture and technopaganism,human
 Technological utopianism ,human
Technological utopianism refers to the belief that technological development is a moral good which can and should bring about a utopia that is a society in which laws governments and social conditions serve the needs of all its citizens,human
Examples of techno-utopian goals include post-scarcity economics life extension mind uploading cryonics and the creation of artificial superintelligence,human
Major techno-utopian movements include transhumanism and singularitarianism,human
The transhumanism movement is founded upon the continued evolution of human life beyond its current human form through science and technology informed by life-promoting principles and values. The movement gained wider popularity in the early 21st century,human
Singularitarians believe that machine superintelligence will accelerate technological progress by orders of magnitude and create even more intelligent entities ever faster which may lead to a pace of societal and technological change that is incomprehensible to us,human
This event horizon is known as the technological singularity,human
Major figures of techno-utopianism include Ray Kurzweil and Nick Bostrom,human
Techno-utopianism has attracted both praise and criticism from progressive religious and conservative thinkers,human
 Anti-technology backlash ,human
Technology's central role in our lives has drawn concerns and backlash,human
The backlash against technology is not a uniform movement and encompasses many heterogeneous ideologies,human
The earliest known revolt against technology was Luddism a pushback against early automation in textile production,human
Automation had resulted in a need for fewer workers a process known as technological unemployment,human

It was partly inspired by Jacques Ellul's The Technological Society,human
Some subcultures like the off-the-grid movement advocate a withdrawal from technology and a return to nature,human
The ecovillage movement seeks to reestablish harmony between technology and nature,human
 Relation to science and engineering ,human
Engineering is the process by which technology is developed,human
It often requires problem-solving under strict constraints,human
Technological development is action-oriented while scientific knowledge is fundamentally explanatory,human
Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: science concerns itself with what is technology with what is to be 375,human
The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists philosophers and policymakers,human
Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human
Despite this modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep domain-specific scientific knowledge,human
In 1975 there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S. by 1989 this increased to an average of one citation per patent,human
The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry chemistry and electronics,human
A 2021 analysis shows that patents that are based on scientific discoveries are on average 26% more valuable than equivalent non-science-based patents,human
The use of basic technology is also a feature of non-human animal species,human
Tool use was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus Homo,human
This view was supplanted after discovering evidence of tool use among chimpanzees and other primates dolphins and crows,human
For example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees using basic foraging tools pestles levers using leaves as sponges and tree bark or vines as probes to fish termites,human
West African chimpanzees use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista Brazil,human
Tool use is not the only form of animal technology use for example beaver dams built with wooden sticks or large stones are a technology with dramatic impacts on river habitats and ecosystems,human
The relationship of humanity with technology has been explored in science-fiction literature for example in Brave New World A Clockwork Orange Nineteen Eighty-Four Isaac Asimov's essays and movies like Minority Report Total Recall Gattaca and Inception,human
It has spawned the dystopian and futuristic cyberpunk genre which juxtaposes futuristic technology with societal collapse dystopia or decay,human
Notable cyberpunk works include William Gibson's Neuromancer novel and movies like Blade Runner and The Matrix,human
Gribbin John Alone in the Milky Way: Why we are probably the only intelligent life in the galaxy Scientific American vol,human
Is life likely to exist elsewhere in the [Mily Way galaxy Almost certainly yes given the speed with which it appeared on Earth,human
Is another technological civilization likely to exist today Almost certainly no given the chain of circumstances that led to our existence,human
These considerations suggest that we are unique not just on our planet but in the whole Milky Way,human
And if our planet is so special it becomes all the more important to preserve this unique world for ourselves our descendants and the many creatures that call Earth home. p,human
Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge to achieve practical goals especially in a reproducible way,human
The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines and intangible ones such as software,human
Technology plays a critical role in science engineering and everyday life,human
Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society,human
The earliest known technology is the stone tool used during prehistory followed by the control of fire—which in turn contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age according to the cooking hypothesis,human
The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines,human
More recent technological inventions including the printing press telephone and the Internet have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy,human
While technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity it can also have negative impacts like pollution and resource depletion and can cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation,human
As a result philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology the ethics of technology and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing,human
Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' from Greek Τεχνολογία from the Greek: τέχνη romanized: tékhnē lit,human
It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word τέχνη tékhnē used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things' which encompassed activities like architecture,human
Starting in the 19th century continental Europeans started using the terms Technik German or technique French to refer to a 'way of doing' which included all technical arts such as dancing navigation or printing whether or not they required tools or instruments,human
At the time Technologie German and French referred either to the academic discipline studying the methods of arts and crafts or to the political discipline intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts. The distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English and so both were translated as technology,human
The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,human
In the 20th century as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends,human
Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error,human
Around 2 Mya million years ago they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble forming a sharp hand axe,human
This practice was refined 75 kya thousand years ago into pressure flaking enabling much finer work,human
The discovery of fire was described by Charles Darwin as possibly the greatest ever made by man,human
Archaeological dietary and social evidence point to continuous human fire-use at least 1.5 Mya,human
Fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten,human
The cooking hypothesis proposes that the ability to cook promoted an increase in hominid brain size though some researchers find the evidence inconclusive,human
Archaeological evidence of hearths was dated to 790 kya researchers believe this is likely to have intensified human socialization and may have contributed to the emergence of language,human
Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era include clothing and shelter,human
No consensus exists on the approximate time of adoption of either technology but archaeologists have found archaeological evidence of clothing 90-120 kya and shelter 450 kya,human
As the Paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as 380 kya humans were constructing temporary wood huts,human
Clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of Africa around 200 kya initially moving to Eurasia,human
The Neolithic Revolution or First Agricultural Revolution brought about an acceleration of technological innovation and a consequent increase in social complexity,human
The invention of the polished stone axe was a major advance that allowed large-scale forest clearance and farming,human
This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic but was originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland,human
Agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed for the simultaneous raising of more children as infants no longer needed to be carried around by nomads,human
Additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could participate in hunter-gatherer activities,human
With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization,human
What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities such as Uruk and the first civilizations such as Sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war among adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role,human
The invention of writing led to the spread of cultural knowledge and became the basis for history libraries schools and scientific research,human
Continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided for the first time the ability to smelt and forge gold copper silver and lead  native metals found in relatively pure form in nature,human
The advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times about 10 kya,human
Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires,human
Eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about BCE,human
The first use of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1,human
After harnessing fire humans discovered other forms of energy,human
The earliest known use of wind power is the sailing ship the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to around 7,human
From prehistoric times Egyptians likely used the power of the annual flooding of the Nile to irrigate their lands gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and catch basins,human
The ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for irrigation,human
Archaeologists estimate that the wheel was invented independently and concurrently in Mesopotamia in present-day Iraq the Northern Caucasus Maykop culture and Central Europe,human
Time estimates range from BCE with most experts putting it closer to BCE,human
The oldest artifacts with drawings depicting wheeled carts date from about BCE,human
More recently the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world as of 2024 was found in the Ljubljana Marsh of Slovenia Austrian experts have established that the wheel is between 5,human
The invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war,human
It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads,human
The ancient Sumerians used a potter's wheel and may have invented it,human
A stone pottery wheel found in the city-state of Ur dates to around  BCE and even older fragments of wheel-thrown pottery have been found in the same area,human
Fast rotary potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy through water wheels windmills and even treadmills that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources,human
The first two-wheeled carts were derived from travois and were first used in Mesopotamia and Iran in around ,human
The oldest known constructed roadways are the stone-paved streets of the city-state of Ur dating to c,human
BCE and timber roads leading through the swamps of Glastonbury England dating to around the same period,human
The first long-distance road which came into use around BCE spanned  from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea but was not paved and was only partially maintained,human
In around  BCE the Minoans on the Greek island of Crete built a 50 km road leading from the palace of Gortyn on the south side of the island through the mountains to the palace of Knossos on the north side of the island,human
Unlike the earlier road the Minoan road was completely paved,human
Ancient Minoan private homes had running water,human
A bathtub virtually identical to modern ones was unearthed at the Palace of Knossos,human
Several Minoan private homes also had toilets which could be flushed by pouring water down the drain,human
The ancient Romans had many public flush toilets which emptied into an extensive sewage system,human
The primary sewer in Rome was the Cloaca Maxima construction began on it in the sixth century BCE and it is still in use today,human
The ancient Romans also had a complex system of aqueducts which were used to transport water across long distances,human
The first Roman aqueduct was built in 312 BCE,human
The eleventh and final ancient Roman aqueduct was built in 226 CE,human
Put together the Roman aqueducts extended over 450 km but less than 70 km of this was above ground and supported by arches,human

Some segments of the 1960s hippie counterculture grew to dislike urban living and developed a preference for locally autonomous sustainable and decentralized technology termed appropriate technology,human
This later influenced hacker culture and technopaganism,human
 Technological utopianism ,human
Technological utopianism refers to the belief that technological development is a moral good which can and should bring about a utopia that is a society in which laws governments and social conditions serve the needs of all its citizens,human
Examples of techno-utopian goals include post-scarcity economics life extension mind uploading cryonics and the creation of artificial superintelligence,human
Major techno-utopian movements include transhumanism and singularitarianism,human
The transhumanism movement is founded upon the continued evolution of human life beyond its current human form through science and technology informed by life-promoting principles and values. The movement gained wider popularity in the early 21st century,human
Singularitarians believe that machine superintelligence will accelerate technological progress by orders of magnitude and create even more intelligent entities ever faster which may lead to a pace of societal and technological change that is incomprehensible to us,human
This event horizon is known as the technological singularity,human
Major figures of techno-utopianism include Ray Kurzweil and Nick Bostrom,human
Techno-utopianism has attracted both praise and criticism from progressive religious and conservative thinkers,human
Technology's central role in our lives has drawn concerns and backlash,human
The backlash against technology is not a uniform movement and encompasses many heterogeneous ideologies,human
The earliest known revolt against technology was Luddism a pushback against early automation in textile production,human
Automation had resulted in a need for fewer workers a process known as technological unemployment,human
Between the 1970s and 1990s American terrorist Ted Kaczynski carried out a series of bombings across America and published the Unabomber Manifesto denouncing technology's negative impacts on nature and human freedom,human

It was partly inspired by Jacques Ellul's The Technological Society,human
Some subcultures like the off-the-grid movement advocate a withdrawal from technology and a return to nature,human
The ecovillage movement seeks to reestablish harmony between technology and nature,human
Engineering is the process by which technology is developed,human
It often requires problem-solving under strict constraints,human
Technological development is action-oriented while scientific knowledge is fundamentally explanatory,human
Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: science concerns itself with what is technology with what is to be 375,human
The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists philosophers and policymakers,human
Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human
Despite this modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep domain-specific scientific knowledge,human
In 1975 there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S. by 1989 this increased to an average of one citation per patent,human
The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry chemistry and electronics,human
A 2021 analysis shows that patents that are based on scientific discoveries are on average 26% more valuable than equivalent non-science-based patents,human
The use of basic technology is also a feature of non-human animal species,human
Tool use was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus Homo,human
This view was supplanted after discovering evidence of tool use among chimpanzees and other primates dolphins and crows,human
For example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees using basic foraging tools pestles levers using leaves as sponges and tree bark or vines as probes to fish termites,human
West African chimpanzees use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista Brazil,human
Tool use is not the only form of animal technology use for example beaver dams built with wooden sticks or large stones are a technology with dramatic impacts on river habitats and ecosystems,human

As a result philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology the ethics of technology and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing,human
Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' from Greek Τεχνολογία from the Greek: τέχνη romanized: tékhnē lit,human
It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word τέχνη tékhnē used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things' which encompassed activities like architecture,human
Starting in the 19th century continental Europeans started using the terms Technik German or technique French to refer to a 'way of doing' which included all technical arts such as dancing navigation or printing whether or not they required tools or instruments,human
At the time Technologie German and French referred either to the academic discipline studying the methods of arts and crafts or to the political discipline intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts. The distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English and so both were translated as technology,human
The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,human
In the 20th century as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends,human
Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error,human
Around 2 Mya million years ago they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble forming a sharp hand axe,human
This practice was refined 75 kya thousand years ago into pressure flaking enabling much finer work,human
The discovery of fire was described by Charles Darwin as possibly the greatest ever made by man,human
Archaeological dietary and social evidence point to continuous human fire-use at least 1.5 Mya,human

The cooking hypothesis proposes that the ability to cook promoted an increase in hominid brain size though some researchers find the evidence inconclusive,human
Archaeological evidence of hearths was dated to 790 kya researchers believe this is likely to have intensified human socialization and may have contributed to the emergence of language,human
Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era include clothing and shelter,human
No consensus exists on the approximate time of adoption of either technology but archaeologists have found archaeological evidence of clothing 90-120 kya and shelter 450 kya,human
As the Paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as 380 kya humans were constructing temporary wood huts,human
Clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of Africa around 200 kya initially moving to Eurasia,human
The Neolithic Revolution or First Agricultural Revolution brought about an acceleration of technological innovation and a consequent increase in social complexity,human
The invention of the polished stone axe was a major advance that allowed large-scale forest clearance and farming,human
This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic but was originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland,human
Agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed for the simultaneous raising of more children as infants no longer needed to be carried around by nomads,human
Additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could participate in hunter-gatherer activities,human
With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization,human
What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities such as Uruk and the first civilizations such as Sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war among adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role,human
The invention of writing led to the spread of cultural knowledge and became the basis for history libraries schools and scientific research,human
Continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided for the first time the ability to smelt and forge gold copper silver and lead  native metals found in relatively pure form in nature,human
The advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times about 10 kya,human
Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires,human
Eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about BCE,human
The first use of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1,human

In medicine new technologies were developed for diagnosis CT PET and MRI scanning treatment like the dialysis machine defibrillator pacemaker and a wide array of new pharmaceutical drugs and research like interferon cloning and DNA microarrays,human
Complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain more modern technologies and entire industries have arisen to develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools,human
Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education their designers builders maintainers and users often require sophisticated general and specific training,human
Moreover these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have developed to support them including engineering medicine and computer science and other fields have become more complex such as construction transportation and architecture,human
Technological change is the largest cause of long-term economic growth,human
Throughout human history energy production was the main constraint on economic development and new technologies allowed humans to significantly increase the amount of available energy,human
First came fire which made edible a wider variety of foods and made it less physically demanding to digest them,human
Fire also enabled smelting and the use of tin copper and iron tools used for hunting or tradesmanship,human
Then came the agricultural revolution: humans no longer needed to hunt or gather to survive and began to settle in towns and cities forming more complex societies with militaries and more organized forms of religion,human

Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: science concerns itself with what is technology with what is to be 375,human
The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists philosophers and policymakers,human
Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human
Despite this modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep domain-specific scientific knowledge,human
In 1975 there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S. by 1989 this increased to an average of one citation per patent,human

Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: science concerns itself with what is technology with what is to be 375,human
The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists philosophers and policymakers,human
Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human

Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: science concerns itself with what is technology with what is to be 375,human
The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists philosophers and policymakers,human
Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human
Despite this modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep domain-specific scientific knowledge,human

Initially technology was seen as an extension of the human organism that replicated or amplified bodily and mental faculties,human
Marx framed it as a tool used by capitalists to oppress the proletariat but believed that technology would be a fundamentally liberating force once it was freed from societal deformations,human
Second-wave philosophers like Ortega later shifted their focus from economics and politics to daily life and living in a techno-material culture arguing that technology could oppress even the members of the bourgeoisie who were its ostensible masters and possessors. Third-stage philosophers like Don Ihde and Albert Borgmann represent a turn toward de-generalization and empiricism and considered how humans can learn to live with technology,human
Early scholarship on technology was split between two arguments: technological determinism and social construction,human
Technological determinism is the idea that technologies cause unavoidable social changes  It usually encompasses a related argument technological autonomy which asserts that technological progress follows a natural progression and cannot be prevented,human
Social constructivists argue that technologies follow no natural progression and are shaped by cultural values laws politics and economic incentives,human
Modern scholarship has shifted towards an analysis of sociotechnical systems assemblages of things people practices and meanings looking at the value judgments that shape technology,human

Examples of techno-utopian goals include post-scarcity economics life extension mind uploading cryonics and the creation of artificial superintelligence,human
Major techno-utopian movements include transhumanism and singularitarianism,human
The transhumanism movement is founded upon the continued evolution of human life beyond its current human form through science and technology informed by life-promoting principles and values. The movement gained wider popularity in the early 21st century,human
Singularitarians believe that machine superintelligence will accelerate technological progress by orders of magnitude and create even more intelligent entities ever faster which may lead to a pace of societal and technological change that is incomprehensible to us,human
This event horizon is known as the technological singularity,human
Major figures of techno-utopianism include Ray Kurzweil and Nick Bostrom,human
Techno-utopianism has attracted both praise and criticism from progressive religious and conservative thinkers,human

Technological development is action-oriented while scientific knowledge is fundamentally explanatory,human
Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: science concerns itself with what is technology with what is to be 375,human
The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists philosophers and policymakers,human
Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human
Despite this modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep domain-specific scientific knowledge,human
In 1975 there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S. by 1989 this increased to an average of one citation per patent,human
The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry chemistry and electronics,human
A 2021 analysis shows that patents that are based on scientific discoveries are on average 26% more valuable than equivalent non-science-based patents,human
The use of basic technology is also a feature of non-human animal species,human

This view was supplanted after discovering evidence of tool use among chimpanzees and other primates dolphins and crows,human
For example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees using basic foraging tools pestles levers using leaves as sponges and tree bark or vines as probes to fish termites,human
West African chimpanzees use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista Brazil,human
Tool use is not the only form of animal technology use for example beaver dams built with wooden sticks or large stones are a technology with dramatic impacts on river habitats and ecosystems,human
The relationship of humanity with technology has been explored in science-fiction literature for example in Brave New World A Clockwork Orange Nineteen Eighty-Four Isaac Asimov's essays and movies like Minority Report Total Recall Gattaca and Inception,human
It has spawned the dystopian and futuristic cyberpunk genre which juxtaposes futuristic technology with societal collapse dystopia or decay,human

As a result philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology the ethics of technology and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing,human
Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' from Greek Τεχνολογία from the Greek: τέχνη romanized: tékhnē lit,human
It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word τέχνη tékhnē used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things' which encompassed activities like architecture,human
Starting in the 19th century continental Europeans started using the terms Technik German or technique French to refer to a 'way of doing' which included all technical arts such as dancing navigation or printing whether or not they required tools or instruments,human
At the time Technologie German and French referred either to the academic discipline studying the methods of arts and crafts or to the political discipline intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts. The distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English and so both were translated as technology,human
The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,human
In the 20th century as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends,human
Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error,human
Around 2 Mya million years ago they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble forming a sharp hand axe,human

With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization,human
What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities such as Uruk and the first civilizations such as Sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war among adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role,human
The invention of writing led to the spread of cultural knowledge and became the basis for history libraries schools and scientific research,human
Continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided for the first time the ability to smelt and forge gold copper silver and lead  native metals found in relatively pure form in nature,human
The advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times about 10 kya,human
Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires,human
Eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about BCE,human
The first use of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1,human
After harnessing fire humans discovered other forms of energy,human
The earliest known use of wind power is the sailing ship the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to around 7,human

Philosophy of technology is a branch of philosophy that studies the practice of designing and creating artifacts and the nature of the things so created. It emerged as a discipline over the past two centuries and has grown considerably since the 1970s,human
The humanities philosophy of technology is concerned with the meaning of technology for and its impact on society and culture,human
Initially technology was seen as an extension of the human organism that replicated or amplified bodily and mental faculties,human
Marx framed it as a tool used by capitalists to oppress the proletariat but believed that technology would be a fundamentally liberating force once it was freed from societal deformations,human
Second-wave philosophers like Ortega later shifted their focus from economics and politics to daily life and living in a techno-material culture arguing that technology could oppress even the members of the bourgeoisie who were its ostensible masters and possessors. Third-stage philosophers like Don Ihde and Albert Borgmann represent a turn toward de-generalization and empiricism and considered how humans can learn to live with technology,human
Early scholarship on technology was split between two arguments: technological determinism and social construction,human
Technological determinism is the idea that technologies cause unavoidable social changes  It usually encompasses a related argument technological autonomy which asserts that technological progress follows a natural progression and cannot be prevented,human
Social constructivists argue that technologies follow no natural progression and are shaped by cultural values laws politics and economic incentives,human
Modern scholarship has shifted towards an analysis of sociotechnical systems assemblages of things people practices and meanings looking at the value judgments that shape technology,human

 Technological utopianism ,human
Technological utopianism refers to the belief that technological development is a moral good which can and should bring about a utopia that is a society in which laws governments and social conditions serve the needs of all its citizens,human
Examples of techno-utopian goals include post-scarcity economics life extension mind uploading cryonics and the creation of artificial superintelligence,human
Major techno-utopian movements include transhumanism and singularitarianism,human
The transhumanism movement is founded upon the continued evolution of human life beyond its current human form through science and technology informed by life-promoting principles and values. The movement gained wider popularity in the early 21st century,human
Singularitarians believe that machine superintelligence will accelerate technological progress by orders of magnitude and create even more intelligent entities ever faster which may lead to a pace of societal and technological change that is incomprehensible to us,human
This event horizon is known as the technological singularity,human
Major figures of techno-utopianism include Ray Kurzweil and Nick Bostrom,human
Techno-utopianism has attracted both praise and criticism from progressive religious and conservative thinkers,human

It was partly inspired by Jacques Ellul's The Technological Society,human
Some subcultures like the off-the-grid movement advocate a withdrawal from technology and a return to nature,human
The ecovillage movement seeks to reestablish harmony between technology and nature,human
 Relation to science and engineering ,human
Engineering is the process by which technology is developed,human
It often requires problem-solving under strict constraints,human
Technological development is action-oriented while scientific knowledge is fundamentally explanatory,human
Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: science concerns itself with what is technology with what is to be 375,human
The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists philosophers and policymakers,human
Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human
Despite this modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep domain-specific scientific knowledge,human
In 1975 there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S. by 1989 this increased to an average of one citation per patent,human
The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry chemistry and electronics,human
A 2021 analysis shows that patents that are based on scientific discoveries are on average 26% more valuable than equivalent non-science-based patents,human
The use of basic technology is also a feature of non-human animal species,human
Tool use was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus Homo,human
This view was supplanted after discovering evidence of tool use among chimpanzees and other primates dolphins and crows,human
For example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees using basic foraging tools pestles levers using leaves as sponges and tree bark or vines as probes to fish termites,human
West African chimpanzees use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista Brazil,human
Tool use is not the only form of animal technology use for example beaver dams built with wooden sticks or large stones are a technology with dramatic impacts on river habitats and ecosystems,human
The relationship of humanity with technology has been explored in science-fiction literature for example in Brave New World A Clockwork Orange Nineteen Eighty-Four Isaac Asimov's essays and movies like Minority Report Total Recall Gattaca and Inception,human
It has spawned the dystopian and futuristic cyberpunk genre which juxtaposes futuristic technology with societal collapse dystopia or decay,human
Notable cyberpunk works include William Gibson's Neuromancer novel and movies like Blade Runner and The Matrix,human
Gribbin John Alone in the Milky Way: Why we are probably the only intelligent life in the galaxy Scientific American vol,human
Is life likely to exist elsewhere in the [Mily Way galaxy Almost certainly yes given the speed with which it appeared on Earth,human
Is another technological civilization likely to exist today Almost certainly no given the chain of circumstances that led to our existence,human
These considerations suggest that we are unique not just on our planet but in the whole Milky Way,human
And if our planet is so special it becomes all the more important to preserve this unique world for ourselves our descendants and the many creatures that call Earth home. p,human
Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge to achieve practical goals especially in a reproducible way,human
The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines and intangible ones such as software,human
Technology plays a critical role in science engineering and everyday life,human
Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society,human
The earliest known technology is the stone tool used during prehistory followed by the control of fire—which in turn contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age according to the cooking hypothesis,human
The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines,human
More recent technological inventions including the printing press telephone and the Internet have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy,human
While technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity it can also have negative impacts like pollution and resource depletion and can cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation,human
As a result philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology the ethics of technology and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing,human
Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' from Greek Τεχνολογία from the Greek: τέχνη romanized: tékhnē lit,human
It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word τέχνη tékhnē used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things' which encompassed activities like architecture,human
Starting in the 19th century continental Europeans started using the terms Technik German or technique French to refer to a 'way of doing' which included all technical arts such as dancing navigation or printing whether or not they required tools or instruments,human
At the time Technologie German and French referred either to the academic discipline studying the methods of arts and crafts or to the political discipline intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts. The distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English and so both were translated as technology,human
The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,human
In the 20th century as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends,human
Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error,human
Around 2 Mya million years ago they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble forming a sharp hand axe,human
This practice was refined 75 kya thousand years ago into pressure flaking enabling much finer work,human
The discovery of fire was described by Charles Darwin as possibly the greatest ever made by man,human
Archaeological dietary and social evidence point to continuous human fire-use at least 1.5 Mya,human
Fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten,human
The cooking hypothesis proposes that the ability to cook promoted an increase in hominid brain size though some researchers find the evidence inconclusive,human
Archaeological evidence of hearths was dated to 790 kya researchers believe this is likely to have intensified human socialization and may have contributed to the emergence of language,human
Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era include clothing and shelter,human
No consensus exists on the approximate time of adoption of either technology but archaeologists have found archaeological evidence of clothing 90-120 kya and shelter 450 kya,human
As the Paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as 380 kya humans were constructing temporary wood huts,human
Clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of Africa around 200 kya initially moving to Eurasia,human
The Neolithic Revolution or First Agricultural Revolution brought about an acceleration of technological innovation and a consequent increase in social complexity,human
The invention of the polished stone axe was a major advance that allowed large-scale forest clearance and farming,human
This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic but was originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland,human
Agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed for the simultaneous raising of more children as infants no longer needed to be carried around by nomads,human
Additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could participate in hunter-gatherer activities,human
With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization,human
What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities such as Uruk and the first civilizations such as Sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war among adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role,human
The invention of writing led to the spread of cultural knowledge and became the basis for history libraries schools and scientific research,human
Continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided for the first time the ability to smelt and forge gold copper silver and lead  native metals found in relatively pure form in nature,human
The advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times about 10 kya,human
Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires,human
Eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about BCE,human
The first use of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1,human
After harnessing fire humans discovered other forms of energy,human
The earliest known use of wind power is the sailing ship the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to around 7,human
From prehistoric times Egyptians likely used the power of the annual flooding of the Nile to irrigate their lands gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and catch basins,human
The ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for irrigation,human
Archaeologists estimate that the wheel was invented independently and concurrently in Mesopotamia in present-day Iraq the Northern Caucasus Maykop culture and Central Europe,human
Time estimates range from BCE with most experts putting it closer to BCE,human
The oldest artifacts with drawings depicting wheeled carts date from about BCE,human
More recently the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world as of 2024 was found in the Ljubljana Marsh of Slovenia Austrian experts have established that the wheel is between 5,human

It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads,human
The ancient Sumerians used a potter's wheel and may have invented it,human
A stone pottery wheel found in the city-state of Ur dates to around  BCE and even older fragments of wheel-thrown pottery have been found in the same area,human

The first two-wheeled carts were derived from travois and were first used in Mesopotamia and Iran in around ,human
The oldest known constructed roadways are the stone-paved streets of the city-state of Ur dating to c,human
BCE and timber roads leading through the swamps of Glastonbury England dating to around the same period,human

Second-wave philosophers like Ortega later shifted their focus from economics and politics to daily life and living in a techno-material culture arguing that technology could oppress even the members of the bourgeoisie who were its ostensible masters and possessors. Third-stage philosophers like Don Ihde and Albert Borgmann represent a turn toward de-generalization and empiricism and considered how humans can learn to live with technology,human
Early scholarship on technology was split between two arguments: technological determinism and social construction,human

Examples of techno-utopian goals include post-scarcity economics life extension mind uploading cryonics and the creation of artificial superintelligence,human
Major techno-utopian movements include transhumanism and singularitarianism,human
The transhumanism movement is founded upon the continued evolution of human life beyond its current human form through science and technology informed by life-promoting principles and values. The movement gained wider popularity in the early 21st century,human
Singularitarians believe that machine superintelligence will accelerate technological progress by orders of magnitude and create even more intelligent entities ever faster which may lead to a pace of societal and technological change that is incomprehensible to us,human

Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: science concerns itself with what is technology with what is to be 375,human
The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists philosophers and policymakers,human
Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240 Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human
Despite this modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep domain-specific scientific knowledge,human

Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' from Greek Τεχνολογία from the Greek: τέχνη romanized: tékhnē lit,human
It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word τέχνη tékhnē used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things' which encompassed activities like architecture,human
Starting in the 19th century continental Europeans started using the terms Technik German or technique French to refer to a 'way of doing' which included all technical arts such as dancing navigation or printing whether or not they required tools or instruments,human
At the time Technologie German and French referred either to the academic discipline studying the methods of arts and crafts or to the political discipline intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts. The distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English and so both were translated as technology,human
The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,human
In the 20th century as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends,human
Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error,human
Around 2 Mya million years ago they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble forming a sharp hand axe,human

Some segments of the 1960s hippie counterculture grew to dislike urban living and developed a preference for locally autonomous sustainable and decentralized technology termed appropriate technology,human
This later influenced hacker culture and technopaganism,human
 Technological utopianism ,human
Technological utopianism refers to the belief that technological development is a moral good which can and should bring about a utopia that is a society in which laws governments and social conditions serve the needs of all its citizens,human
Examples of techno-utopian goals include post-scarcity economics life extension mind uploading cryonics and the creation of artificial superintelligence,human
Major techno-utopian movements include transhumanism and singularitarianism,human
The transhumanism movement is founded upon the continued evolution of human life beyond its current human form through science and technology informed by life-promoting principles and values. The movement gained wider popularity in the early 21st century,human
Singularitarians believe that machine superintelligence will accelerate technological progress by orders of magnitude and create even more intelligent entities ever faster which may lead to a pace of societal and technological change that is incomprehensible to us,human
This event horizon is known as the technological singularity,human
Major figures of techno-utopianism include Ray Kurzweil and Nick Bostrom,human
Techno-utopianism has attracted both praise and criticism from progressive religious and conservative thinkers,human
 Anti-technology backlash ,human
Technology's central role in our lives has drawn concerns and backlash,human
The backlash against technology is not a uniform movement and encompasses many heterogeneous ideologies,human
The earliest known revolt against technology was Luddism a pushback against early automation in textile production,human
Automation had resulted in a need for fewer workers a process known as technological unemployment,human

 Relation to science and engineering ,human
Engineering is the process by which technology is developed,human
It often requires problem-solving under strict constraints,human
Technological development is action-oriented while scientific knowledge is fundamentally explanatory,human
Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: science concerns itself with what is technology with what is to be 375,human
The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists philosophers and policymakers,human
Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human
Despite this modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep domain-specific scientific knowledge,human
In 1975 there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S. by 1989 this increased to an average of one citation per patent,human
The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry chemistry and electronics,human
A 2021 analysis shows that patents that are based on scientific discoveries are on average 26% more valuable than equivalent non-science-based patents,human
The use of basic technology is also a feature of non-human animal species,human
Tool use was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus Homo,human
This view was supplanted after discovering evidence of tool use among chimpanzees and other primates dolphins and crows,human
For example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees using basic foraging tools pestles levers using leaves as sponges and tree bark or vines as probes to fish termites,human
West African chimpanzees use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista Brazil,human
Tool use is not the only form of animal technology use for example beaver dams built with wooden sticks or large stones are a technology with dramatic impacts on river habitats and ecosystems,human
The relationship of humanity with technology has been explored in science-fiction literature for example in Brave New World A Clockwork Orange Nineteen Eighty-Four Isaac Asimov's essays and movies like Minority Report Total Recall Gattaca and Inception,human
It has spawned the dystopian and futuristic cyberpunk genre which juxtaposes futuristic technology with societal collapse dystopia or decay,human
Notable cyberpunk works include William Gibson's Neuromancer novel and movies like Blade Runner and The Matrix,human
Gribbin John Alone in the Milky Way: Why we are probably the only intelligent life in the galaxy Scientific American vol,human
Is life likely to exist elsewhere in the [Mily Way galaxy Almost certainly yes given the speed with which it appeared on Earth,human
Is another technological civilization likely to exist today Almost certainly no given the chain of circumstances that led to our existence,human

Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge to achieve practical goals especially in a reproducible way,human
The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines and intangible ones such as software,human
Technology plays a critical role in science engineering and everyday life,human
Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society,human
The earliest known technology is the stone tool used during prehistory followed by the control of fire—which in turn contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age according to the cooking hypothesis,human
The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines,human
More recent technological inventions including the printing press telephone and the Internet have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy,human
While technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity it can also have negative impacts like pollution and resource depletion and can cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation,human
As a result philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology the ethics of technology and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing,human
Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' from Greek Τεχνολογία from the Greek: τέχνη romanized: tékhnē lit,human
It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word τέχνη tékhnē used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things' which encompassed activities like architecture,human
Starting in the 19th century continental Europeans started using the terms Technik German or technique French to refer to a 'way of doing' which included all technical arts such as dancing navigation or printing whether or not they required tools or instruments,human
At the time Technologie German and French referred either to the academic discipline studying the methods of arts and crafts or to the political discipline intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts. The distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English and so both were translated as technology,human
The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,human
In the 20th century as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends,human
Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error,human
Around 2 Mya million years ago they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble forming a sharp hand axe,human
This practice was refined 75 kya thousand years ago into pressure flaking enabling much finer work,human
The discovery of fire was described by Charles Darwin as possibly the greatest ever made by man,human
Archaeological dietary and social evidence point to continuous human fire-use at least 1.5 Mya,human
Fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten,human
The cooking hypothesis proposes that the ability to cook promoted an increase in hominid brain size though some researchers find the evidence inconclusive,human
Archaeological evidence of hearths was dated to 790 kya researchers believe this is likely to have intensified human socialization and may have contributed to the emergence of language,human
Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era include clothing and shelter,human
No consensus exists on the approximate time of adoption of either technology but archaeologists have found archaeological evidence of clothing 90-120 kya and shelter 450 kya,human
As the Paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as 380 kya humans were constructing temporary wood huts,human
Clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of Africa around 200 kya initially moving to Eurasia,human
The Neolithic Revolution or First Agricultural Revolution brought about an acceleration of technological innovation and a consequent increase in social complexity,human
The invention of the polished stone axe was a major advance that allowed large-scale forest clearance and farming,human
This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic but was originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland,human
Agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed for the simultaneous raising of more children as infants no longer needed to be carried around by nomads,human
Additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could participate in hunter-gatherer activities,human
With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization,human
What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities such as Uruk and the first civilizations such as Sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war among adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role,human
The invention of writing led to the spread of cultural knowledge and became the basis for history libraries schools and scientific research,human
Continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided for the first time the ability to smelt and forge gold copper silver and lead  native metals found in relatively pure form in nature,human
The advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times about 10 kya,human
Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires,human
Eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about BCE,human
The first use of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1,human
After harnessing fire humans discovered other forms of energy,human

The first two-wheeled carts were derived from travois and were first used in Mesopotamia and Iran in around ,human
The oldest known constructed roadways are the stone-paved streets of the city-state of Ur dating to c,human
BCE and timber roads leading through the swamps of Glastonbury England dating to around the same period,human
The first long-distance road which came into use around BCE spanned  from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea but was not paved and was only partially maintained,human
In around  BCE the Minoans on the Greek island of Crete built a 50 km road leading from the palace of Gortyn on the south side of the island through the mountains to the palace of Knossos on the north side of the island,human
Unlike the earlier road the Minoan road was completely paved,human
Ancient Minoan private homes had running water,human
A bathtub virtually identical to modern ones was unearthed at the Palace of Knossos,human
Several Minoan private homes also had toilets which could be flushed by pouring water down the drain,human
The ancient Romans had many public flush toilets which emptied into an extensive sewage system,human
The primary sewer in Rome was the Cloaca Maxima construction began on it in the sixth century BCE and it is still in use today,human
The ancient Romans also had a complex system of aqueducts which were used to transport water across long distances,human
The first Roman aqueduct was built in 312 BCE,human
The eleventh and final ancient Roman aqueduct was built in 226 CE,human

In medicine new technologies were developed for diagnosis CT PET and MRI scanning treatment like the dialysis machine defibrillator pacemaker and a wide array of new pharmaceutical drugs and research like interferon cloning and DNA microarrays,human
Complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain more modern technologies and entire industries have arisen to develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools,human
Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education  their designers builders maintainers and users often require sophisticated general and specific training,human
Moreover these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have developed to support them including engineering medicine and computer science and other fields have become more complex such as construction transportation and architecture,human
Technological change is the largest cause of long-term economic growth,human
Throughout human history energy production was the main constraint on economic development and new technologies allowed humans to significantly increase the amount of available energy,human
First came fire which made edible a wider variety of foods and made it less physically demanding to digest them,human
Fire also enabled smelting and the use of tin copper and iron tools used for hunting or tradesmanship,human
Then came the agricultural revolution: humans no longer needed to hunt or gather to survive and began to settle in towns and cities forming more complex societies with militaries and more organized forms of religion,human
Technologies have contributed to human welfare through increased prosperity improved comfort and quality of life and medical progress but they can also disrupt existing social hierarchies cause pollution and harm individuals or groups,human

Political science experts predict that this could lead to a rise in extremism while others see it as an opportunity to usher in a post-scarcity economy,human
Some segments of the 1960s hippie counterculture grew to dislike urban living and developed a preference for locally autonomous sustainable and decentralized technology termed appropriate technology,human
This later influenced hacker culture and technopaganism,human
 Technological utopianism ,human
Technological utopianism refers to the belief that technological development is a moral good which can and should bring about a utopia that is a society in which laws governments and social conditions serve the needs of all its citizens,human
Examples of techno-utopian goals include post-scarcity economics life extension mind uploading cryonics and the creation of artificial superintelligence,human
Major techno-utopian movements include transhumanism and singularitarianism,human
The transhumanism movement is founded upon the continued evolution of human life beyond its current human form through science and technology informed by life-promoting principles and values. The movement gained wider popularity in the early 21st century,human
Singularitarians believe that machine superintelligence will accelerate technological progress by orders of magnitude and create even more intelligent entities ever faster which may lead to a pace of societal and technological change that is incomprehensible to us,human
This event horizon is known as the technological singularity,human
Major figures of techno-utopianism include Ray Kurzweil and Nick Bostrom,human
Techno-utopianism has attracted both praise and criticism from progressive religious and conservative thinkers,human
 Anti-technology backlash ,human
Technology's central role in our lives has drawn concerns and backlash,human
The backlash against technology is not a uniform movement and encompasses many heterogeneous ideologies,human
The earliest known revolt against technology was Luddism a pushback against early automation in textile production,human
Automation had resulted in a need for fewer workers a process known as technological unemployment,human
Between the 1970s and 1990s American terrorist Ted Kaczynski carried out a series of bombings across America and published the Unabomber Manifesto denouncing technology's negative impacts on nature and human freedom,human
The essay resonated with a large part of the American public,human
It was partly inspired by Jacques Ellul's The Technological Society,human
Some subcultures like the off-the-grid movement advocate a withdrawal from technology and a return to nature,human
The ecovillage movement seeks to reestablish harmony between technology and nature,human
 Relation to science and engineering ,human
Engineering is the process by which technology is developed,human
It often requires problem-solving under strict constraints,human
Technological development is action-oriented while scientific knowledge is fundamentally explanatory,human
Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: science concerns itself with what is technology with what is to be 375,human
The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists philosophers and policymakers,human
Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human
Despite this modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep domain-specific scientific knowledge,human
In 1975 there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S. by 1989 this increased to an average of one citation per patent,human
The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry chemistry and electronics,human
A 2021 analysis shows that patents that are based on scientific discoveries are on average 26% more valuable than equivalent non-science-based patents,human
The use of basic technology is also a feature of non-human animal species,human
Tool use was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus Homo,human
This view was supplanted after discovering evidence of tool use among chimpanzees and other primates dolphins and crows,human
For example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees using basic foraging tools pestles levers using leaves as sponges and tree bark or vines as probes to fish termites,human
West African chimpanzees use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista Brazil,human
Tool use is not the only form of animal technology use for example beaver dams built with wooden sticks or large stones are a technology with dramatic impacts on river habitats and ecosystems,human
The relationship of humanity with technology has been explored in science-fiction literature for example in Brave New World A Clockwork Orange Nineteen Eighty-Four Isaac Asimov's essays and movies like Minority Report Total Recall Gattaca and Inception,human
It has spawned the dystopian and futuristic cyberpunk genre which juxtaposes futuristic technology with societal collapse dystopia or decay,human
Notable cyberpunk works include William Gibson's Neuromancer novel and movies like Blade Runner and The Matrix,human
Gribbin John Alone in the Milky Way: Why we are probably the only intelligent life in the galaxy Scientific American vol,human
Is life likely to exist elsewhere in the [Mily Way galaxy Almost certainly yes given the speed with which it appeared on Earth,human
Is another technological civilization likely to exist today Almost certainly no given the chain of circumstances that led to our existence,human
These considerations suggest that we are unique not just on our planet but in the whole Milky Way,human
And if our planet is so special it becomes all the more important to preserve this unique world for ourselves our descendants and the many creatures that call Earth home. p,human

The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines,human
More recent technological inventions including the printing press telephone and the Internet have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy,human
While technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity it can also have negative impacts like pollution and resource depletion and can cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation,human
As a result philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology the ethics of technology and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing,human
Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' from Greek Τεχνολογία from the Greek: τέχνη romanized: tékhnē lit,human
It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word τέχνη tékhnē used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things' which encompassed activities like architecture,human
Starting in the 19th century continental Europeans started using the terms Technik German or technique French to refer to a 'way of doing' which included all technical arts such as dancing navigation or printing whether or not they required tools or instruments,human
At the time Technologie German and French referred either to the academic discipline studying the methods of arts and crafts or to the political discipline intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts. The distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English and so both were translated as technology,human
The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,human
In the 20th century as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends,human
Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error,human
Around 2 Mya million years ago they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble forming a sharp hand axe,human
This practice was refined 75 kya thousand years ago into pressure flaking enabling much finer work,human
The discovery of fire was described by Charles Darwin as possibly the greatest ever made by man,human
Archaeological dietary and social evidence point to continuous human fire-use at least 1.5 Mya,human

The cooking hypothesis proposes that the ability to cook promoted an increase in hominid brain size though some researchers find the evidence inconclusive,human
Archaeological evidence of hearths was dated to 790 kya researchers believe this is likely to have intensified human socialization and may have contributed to the emergence of language,human
Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era include clothing and shelter,human
No consensus exists on the approximate time of adoption of either technology but archaeologists have found archaeological evidence of clothing 90-120 kya and shelter 450 kya,human
As the Paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as 380 kya humans were constructing temporary wood huts,human
Clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of Africa around 200 kya initially moving to Eurasia,human
The Neolithic Revolution or First Agricultural Revolution brought about an acceleration of technological innovation and a consequent increase in social complexity,human

This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic but was originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland,human
Agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed for the simultaneous raising of more children as infants no longer needed to be carried around by nomads,human
Additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could participate in hunter-gatherer activities,human
With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization,human
What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities such as Uruk and the first civilizations such as Sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war among adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role,human
The invention of writing led to the spread of cultural knowledge and became the basis for history libraries schools and scientific research,human
Continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided for the first time the ability to smelt and forge gold copper silver and lead  native metals found in relatively pure form in nature,human
The advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times about 10 kya,human
Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires,human
Eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about BCE,human
The first use of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1,human
After harnessing fire humans discovered other forms of energy,human
The earliest known use of wind power is the sailing ship the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to around 7,human

The ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for irrigation,human
Archaeologists estimate that the wheel was invented independently and concurrently in Mesopotamia in present-day Iraq the Northern Caucasus Maykop culture and Central Europe,human
Time estimates range from BCE with most experts putting it closer to BCE,human
The oldest artifacts with drawings depicting wheeled carts date from about BCE,human
More recently the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world as of 2024 was found in the Ljubljana Marsh of Slovenia Austrian experts have established that the wheel is between 5,human

The ancient Sumerians used a potter's wheel and may have invented it,human
A stone pottery wheel found in the city-state of Ur dates to around  BCE and even older fragments of wheel-thrown pottery have been found in the same area,human
Fast rotary potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy through water wheels windmills and even treadmills that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources,human
The first two-wheeled carts were derived from travois and were first used in Mesopotamia and Iran in around ,human
The oldest known constructed roadways are the stone-paved streets of the city-state of Ur dating to c,human

Ancient Minoan private homes had running water,human
A bathtub virtually identical to modern ones was unearthed at the Palace of Knossos,human
Several Minoan private homes also had toilets which could be flushed by pouring water down the drain,human
The ancient Romans had many public flush toilets which emptied into an extensive sewage system,human
The primary sewer in Rome was the Cloaca Maxima construction began on it in the sixth century BCE and it is still in use today,human
The ancient Romans also had a complex system of aqueducts which were used to transport water across long distances,human
The first Roman aqueduct was built in 312 BCE,human

The humanities philosophy of technology is concerned with the meaning of technology for and its impact on society and culture,human
Initially technology was seen as an extension of the human organism that replicated or amplified bodily and mental faculties,human
Marx framed it as a tool used by capitalists to oppress the proletariat but believed that technology would be a fundamentally liberating force once it was freed from societal deformations,human
Second-wave philosophers like Ortega later shifted their focus from economics and politics to daily life and living in a techno-material culture arguing that technology could oppress even the members of the bourgeoisie who were its ostensible masters and possessors. Third-stage philosophers like Don Ihde and Albert Borgmann represent a turn toward de-generalization and empiricism and considered how humans can learn to live with technology,human
Early scholarship on technology was split between two arguments: technological determinism and social construction,human
Technological determinism is the idea that technologies cause unavoidable social changes  It usually encompasses a related argument technological autonomy which asserts that technological progress follows a natural progression and cannot be prevented,human
Social constructivists argue that technologies follow no natural progression and are shaped by cultural values laws politics and economic incentives,human
Modern scholarship has shifted towards an analysis of sociotechnical systems assemblages of things people practices and meanings looking at the value judgments that shape technology,human

While technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity it can also have negative impacts like pollution and resource depletion and can cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation,human
As a result philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology the ethics of technology and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing,human
Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' from Greek Τεχνολογία from the Greek: τέχνη romanized: tékhnē lit,human
It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word τέχνη tékhnē used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things' which encompassed activities like architecture,human
Starting in the 19th century continental Europeans started using the terms Technik German or technique French to refer to a 'way of doing' which included all technical arts such as dancing navigation or printing whether or not they required tools or instruments,human
At the time Technologie German and French referred either to the academic discipline studying the methods of arts and crafts or to the political discipline intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts. The distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English and so both were translated as technology,human
The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,human
In the 20th century as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends,human
Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error,human
Around 2 Mya million years ago they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble forming a sharp hand axe,human
This practice was refined 75 kya thousand years ago into pressure flaking enabling much finer work,human
The discovery of fire was described by Charles Darwin as possibly the greatest ever made by man,human
Archaeological dietary and social evidence point to continuous human fire-use at least 1.5 Mya,human
Fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten,human
The cooking hypothesis proposes that the ability to cook promoted an increase in hominid brain size though some researchers find the evidence inconclusive,human
Archaeological evidence of hearths was dated to 790 kya researchers believe this is likely to have intensified human socialization and may have contributed to the emergence of language,human
Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era include clothing and shelter,human
No consensus exists on the approximate time of adoption of either technology but archaeologists have found archaeological evidence of clothing 90-120 kya and shelter 450 kya,human
As the Paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as 380 kya humans were constructing temporary wood huts,human
Clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of Africa around 200 kya initially moving to Eurasia,human
The Neolithic Revolution or First Agricultural Revolution brought about an acceleration of technological innovation and a consequent increase in social complexity,human
The invention of the polished stone axe was a major advance that allowed large-scale forest clearance and farming,human
This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic but was originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland,human
Agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed for the simultaneous raising of more children as infants no longer needed to be carried around by nomads,human
Additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could participate in hunter-gatherer activities,human
With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization,human
What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities such as Uruk and the first civilizations such as Sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war among adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role,human
The invention of writing led to the spread of cultural knowledge and became the basis for history libraries schools and scientific research,human
Continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided for the first time the ability to smelt and forge gold copper silver and lead  native metals found in relatively pure form in nature,human
The advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times about 10 kya,human
Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires,human
Eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about BCE,human
The first use of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1,human
After harnessing fire humans discovered other forms of energy,human
The earliest known use of wind power is the sailing ship the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to around 7,human

The ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for irrigation,human
Archaeologists estimate that the wheel was invented independently and concurrently in Mesopotamia in present-day Iraq the Northern Caucasus Maykop culture and Central Europe,human
Time estimates range from BCE with most experts putting it closer to BCE,human
The oldest artifacts with drawings depicting wheeled carts date from about BCE,human
More recently the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world as of 2024 was found in the Ljubljana Marsh of Slovenia Austrian experts have established that the wheel is between 5,human

The first two-wheeled carts were derived from travois and were first used in Mesopotamia and Iran in around ,human
The oldest known constructed roadways are the stone-paved streets of the city-state of Ur dating to c,human
BCE and timber roads leading through the swamps of Glastonbury England dating to around the same period,human
The first long-distance road which came into use around BCE spanned  from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea but was not paved and was only partially maintained,human
In around  BCE the Minoans on the Greek island of Crete built a 50 km road leading from the palace of Gortyn on the south side of the island through the mountains to the palace of Knossos on the north side of the island,human
Unlike the earlier road the Minoan road was completely paved,human
Ancient Minoan private homes had running water,human
A bathtub virtually identical to modern ones was unearthed at the Palace of Knossos,human
Several Minoan private homes also had toilets which could be flushed by pouring water down the drain,human
The ancient Romans had many public flush toilets which emptied into an extensive sewage system,human
The primary sewer in Rome was the Cloaca Maxima construction began on it in the sixth century BCE and it is still in use today,human
The ancient Romans also had a complex system of aqueducts which were used to transport water across long distances,human
The first Roman aqueduct was built in 312 BCE,human
The eleventh and final ancient Roman aqueduct was built in 226 CE,human

The humanities philosophy of technology is concerned with the meaning of technology for and its impact on society and culture,human
Initially technology was seen as an extension of the human organism that replicated or amplified bodily and mental faculties,human
Marx framed it as a tool used by capitalists to oppress the proletariat but believed that technology would be a fundamentally liberating force once it was freed from societal deformations,human
Second-wave philosophers like Ortega later shifted their focus from economics and politics to daily life and living in a techno-material culture arguing that technology could oppress even the members of the bourgeoisie who were its ostensible masters and possessors. Third-stage philosophers like Don Ihde and Albert Borgmann represent a turn toward de-generalization and empiricism and considered how humans can learn to live with technology,human
Early scholarship on technology was split between two arguments: technological determinism and social construction,human
Technological determinism is the idea that technologies cause unavoidable social changes  It usually encompasses a related argument technological autonomy which asserts that technological progress follows a natural progression and cannot be prevented,human
Social constructivists argue that technologies follow no natural progression and are shaped by cultural values laws politics and economic incentives,human
Modern scholarship has shifted towards an analysis of sociotechnical systems assemblages of things people practices and meanings looking at the value judgments that shape technology,human

While technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity it can also have negative impacts like pollution and resource depletion and can cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation,human
As a result philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology the ethics of technology and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing,human
Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' from Greek Τεχνολογία from the Greek: τέχνη romanized: tékhnē lit,human
It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word τέχνη tékhnē used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things' which encompassed activities like architecture,human
Starting in the 19th century continental Europeans started using the terms Technik German or technique French to refer to a 'way of doing' which included all technical arts such as dancing navigation or printing whether or not they required tools or instruments,human
At the time Technologie German and French referred either to the academic discipline studying the methods of arts and crafts or to the political discipline intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts. The distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English and so both were translated as technology,human
The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,human
In the 20th century as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends,human
Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error,human
Around 2 Mya million years ago they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble forming a sharp hand axe,human
This practice was refined 75 kya thousand years ago into pressure flaking enabling much finer work,human
The discovery of fire was described by Charles Darwin as possibly the greatest ever made by man,human
Archaeological dietary and social evidence point to continuous human fire-use at least 1.5 Mya,human
Fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten,human
The cooking hypothesis proposes that the ability to cook promoted an increase in hominid brain size though some researchers find the evidence inconclusive,human
Archaeological evidence of hearths was dated to 790 kya researchers believe this is likely to have intensified human socialization and may have contributed to the emergence of language,human
Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era include clothing and shelter,human
No consensus exists on the approximate time of adoption of either technology but archaeologists have found archaeological evidence of clothing 90-120 kya and shelter 450 kya,human
As the Paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as 380 kya humans were constructing temporary wood huts,human
Clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of Africa around 200 kya initially moving to Eurasia,human
The Neolithic Revolution or First Agricultural Revolution brought about an acceleration of technological innovation and a consequent increase in social complexity,human
The invention of the polished stone axe was a major advance that allowed large-scale forest clearance and farming,human
This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic but was originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland,human
Agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed for the simultaneous raising of more children as infants no longer needed to be carried around by nomads,human
Additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could participate in hunter-gatherer activities,human
With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization,human
What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities such as Uruk and the first civilizations such as Sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war among adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role,human

Continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided for the first time the ability to smelt and forge gold copper silver and lead  native metals found in relatively pure form in nature,human
The advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times about 10 kya,human
Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires,human

Initially technology was seen as an extension of the human organism that replicated or amplified bodily and mental faculties,human
Marx framed it as a tool used by capitalists to oppress the proletariat but believed that technology would be a fundamentally liberating force once it was freed from societal deformations,human
Second-wave philosophers like Ortega later shifted their focus from economics and politics to daily life and living in a techno-material culture arguing that technology could oppress even the members of the bourgeoisie who were its ostensible masters and possessors. Third-stage philosophers like Don Ihde and Albert Borgmann represent a turn toward de-generalization and empiricism and considered how humans can learn to live with technology,human
Early scholarship on technology was split between two arguments: technological determinism and social construction,human
Technological determinism is the idea that technologies cause unavoidable social changes  It usually encompasses a related argument technological autonomy which asserts that technological progress follows a natural progression and cannot be prevented,human

Technological utopianism refers to the belief that technological development is a moral good which can and should bring about a utopia that is a society in which laws governments and social conditions serve the needs of all its citizens,human
Examples of techno-utopian goals include post-scarcity economics life extension mind uploading cryonics and the creation of artificial superintelligence,human
Major techno-utopian movements include transhumanism and singularitarianism,human
The transhumanism movement is founded upon the continued evolution of human life beyond its current human form through science and technology informed by life-promoting principles and values. The movement gained wider popularity in the early 21st century,human
Singularitarians believe that machine superintelligence will accelerate technological progress by orders of magnitude and create even more intelligent entities ever faster which may lead to a pace of societal and technological change that is incomprehensible to us,human
This event horizon is known as the technological singularity,human
Major figures of techno-utopianism include Ray Kurzweil and Nick Bostrom,human
Techno-utopianism has attracted both praise and criticism from progressive religious and conservative thinkers,human

 Relation to science and engineering ,human
Engineering is the process by which technology is developed,human
It often requires problem-solving under strict constraints,human
Technological development is action-oriented while scientific knowledge is fundamentally explanatory,human
Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: science concerns itself with what is technology with what is to be 375,human
The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists philosophers and policymakers,human
Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human
Despite this modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep domain-specific scientific knowledge,human
In 1975 there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S. by 1989 this increased to an average of one citation per patent,human
The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry chemistry and electronics,human
A 2021 analysis shows that patents that are based on scientific discoveries are on average 26% more valuable than equivalent non-science-based patents,human
The use of basic technology is also a feature of non-human animal species,human
Tool use was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus Homo,human
This view was supplanted after discovering evidence of tool use among chimpanzees and other primates dolphins and crows,human
For example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees using basic foraging tools pestles levers using leaves as sponges and tree bark or vines as probes to fish termites,human
West African chimpanzees use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista Brazil,human
Tool use is not the only form of animal technology use for example beaver dams built with wooden sticks or large stones are a technology with dramatic impacts on river habitats and ecosystems,human
The relationship of humanity with technology has been explored in science-fiction literature for example in Brave New World A Clockwork Orange Nineteen Eighty-Four Isaac Asimov's essays and movies like Minority Report Total Recall Gattaca and Inception,human
It has spawned the dystopian and futuristic cyberpunk genre which juxtaposes futuristic technology with societal collapse dystopia or decay,human
Notable cyberpunk works include William Gibson's Neuromancer novel and movies like Blade Runner and The Matrix,human

Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human

Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human

Initially technology was seen as an extension of the human organism that replicated or amplified bodily and mental faculties,human
Marx framed it as a tool used by capitalists to oppress the proletariat but believed that technology would be a fundamentally liberating force once it was freed from societal deformations,human
Second-wave philosophers like Ortega later shifted their focus from economics and politics to daily life and living in a techno-material culture arguing that technology could oppress even the members of the bourgeoisie who were its ostensible masters and possessors. Third-stage philosophers like Don Ihde and Albert Borgmann represent a turn toward de-generalization and empiricism and considered how humans can learn to live with technology,human
Early scholarship on technology was split between two arguments: technological determinism and social construction,human
Technological determinism is the idea that technologies cause unavoidable social changes  It usually encompasses a related argument technological autonomy which asserts that technological progress follows a natural progression and cannot be prevented,human
Social constructivists argue that technologies follow no natural progression and are shaped by cultural values laws politics and economic incentives,human
Modern scholarship has shifted towards an analysis of sociotechnical systems assemblages of things people practices and meanings looking at the value judgments that shape technology,human

Examples of techno-utopian goals include post-scarcity economics life extension mind uploading cryonics and the creation of artificial superintelligence,human
Major techno-utopian movements include transhumanism and singularitarianism,human
The transhumanism movement is founded upon the continued evolution of human life beyond its current human form through science and technology informed by life-promoting principles and values. The movement gained wider popularity in the early 21st century,human
Singularitarians believe that machine superintelligence will accelerate technological progress by orders of magnitude and create even more intelligent entities ever faster which may lead to a pace of societal and technological change that is incomprehensible to us,human
This event horizon is known as the technological singularity,human
Major figures of techno-utopianism include Ray Kurzweil and Nick Bostrom,human
Techno-utopianism has attracted both praise and criticism from progressive religious and conservative thinkers,human

Technological development is action-oriented while scientific knowledge is fundamentally explanatory,human
Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: science concerns itself with what is technology with what is to be 375,human
The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists philosophers and policymakers,human
Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge but instead from engineering tinkering and chance 217240  For example in the 1940s and 1950s when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude jet engines were invented through running the device to destruction analyzing what brok [... and repeating the process,human
Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them 217240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination,human
Since the 1960s the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility,human
Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes,human
Despite this modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep domain-specific scientific knowledge,human
In 1975 there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S. by 1989 this increased to an average of one citation per patent,human
The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry chemistry and electronics,human

This view was supplanted after discovering evidence of tool use among chimpanzees and other primates dolphins and crows,human
For example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees using basic foraging tools pestles levers using leaves as sponges and tree bark or vines as probes to fish termites,human
West African chimpanzees use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista Brazil,human
Tool use is not the only form of animal technology use for example beaver dams built with wooden sticks or large stones are a technology with dramatic impacts on river habitats and ecosystems,human
The relationship of humanity with technology has been explored in science-fiction literature for example in Brave New World A Clockwork Orange Nineteen Eighty-Four Isaac Asimov's essays and movies like Minority Report Total Recall Gattaca and Inception,human
It has spawned the dystopian and futuristic cyberpunk genre which juxtaposes futuristic technology with societal collapse dystopia or decay,human

As a result philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology the ethics of technology and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing,human
Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' from Greek Τεχνολογία from the Greek: τέχνη romanized: tékhnē lit,human
It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word τέχνη tékhnē used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things' which encompassed activities like architecture,human
Starting in the 19th century continental Europeans started using the terms Technik German or technique French to refer to a 'way of doing' which included all technical arts such as dancing navigation or printing whether or not they required tools or instruments,human
At the time Technologie German and French referred either to the academic discipline studying the methods of arts and crafts or to the political discipline intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts. The distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English and so both were translated as technology,human
The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,human
In the 20th century as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends,human
Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error,human
Around 2 Mya million years ago they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble forming a sharp hand axe,human

What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities such as Uruk and the first civilizations such as Sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war among adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role,human
The invention of writing led to the spread of cultural knowledge and became the basis for history libraries schools and scientific research,human
Continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided for the first time the ability to smelt and forge gold copper silver and lead  native metals found in relatively pure form in nature,human
The advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times about 10 kya,human
Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires,human
Eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about BCE,human
The first use of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1,human
